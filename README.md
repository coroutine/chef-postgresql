Description
===========
This is a fork of the Opscode PostgreSQL cookbook, which has been modified 
extensively.

* Adds support for PostgresQL 9.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) using a PPA. 
* Adds a recipe to create PostgreSQL user accounts and databases (this 
  particular addition couples this to the `database` cookbook)
* Adds support for configuring Hot Standby with Streaming replication
  (optionally synchronous) in PostgreSQL 9.1

*TODO*: while hot-standby is configured, there's nothing in postgresql that'll 
do automated failover if the master dies.  Typically, that's accomplished by:

* touching a trigger file on the standby (it'll then act as a master)
* using some form of IP failover so the Master's IP address is automatically
  transferred to the standby
* some STONITH mechanism for the old master, so it doesn't come back online

None of the above are handled automatically in this cookbook.

Requirements
============

## Platforms

* Debian, Ubuntu
* Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific (6.0+ required) - "EL6-family"
* Fedora
* SUSE

**Note**: Hot Standby and Streaming replication are only supported on Debian
and Ubuntu.

## Cookboooks

Requires Opscode's `openssl` cookbook for secure password generation, and a C
compiler and development headers in order to build the `pg` RubyGem to provide
Ruby bindings so they're available in other cookbooks.

Opscode's `build-essential` cookbook provides this functionality on
Debian, Ubuntu, and EL6-family.

While not required, Opscode's `database` cookbook contains resources and
providers that can interact with a PostgreSQL database. The Opscode 
`postgresql`cookbook is a dependency of database.

Attributes
==========

The following attributes are set based on the platform, see the
`attributes/default.rb` file for default values.

* `node['postgresql']['version']` - version of postgresql to manage
* `node['postgresql']['dir']` - home directory of where postgresql
  data and configuration lives.
* `node['postgresql']['client']['packages']` - An array of package names
  that should be installed on "client" systems.
* `node['postgresql']['server']['packages']` - An array of package names
  that should be installed on "server" systems.

The following attributes are generated in
`recipe[postgresql::server]`.

* `node['postgresql']['password']['postgres']` - randomly generated
  password by the `openssl` cookbook's library.
* `node['postgresql']['ssl']` - whether to enable SSL (off for version
  8.3, true for 8.4 and later).

The following attributes are used by the `setup` recipe:
* `node['postgresql']['databag']` - the data bag in which the `setup` recipe
  searches for items. Default is `postgresql`
* `node['postgresql']['setup_items']` - a list of data bag items 
  containing user/database information. See the notes for the `setup` recipe
  for the expected format.

There are also a number of other attributes defined that control  things such
as host based access (`pg_hba.conf`) and hot standby. A few are listed below,
but see `attributes/default.rb` for more information.
* `node['postgresql']['hba']` - a list of `address`/`method` hashes
  defining the ip address that will be able to connect to PostreSQL

Streaming Replication
---------------------

The following attributes can be modified to enable and configure streaming 
replication and for a Master or Standby.

* `default[:postgresql][:listen_addresses]`
* `default[:postgresql][:master]` - Whether a node is a master. Defaults to 
  false. In this case, replication will not be configured, and the rest of the 
  master settings will be ignored.
* `default[:postgresql][:standby]` - Whether a node is a standby. Defaults to 
  false. In this case, replication will not be configured, and the rest of the 
  standby settings will be ignored.

### Master Server

* `default[:postgresql][:wal_level]` - set to `hot_standby` to enable Hot standby.
* `default[:postgresql][:max_wal_senders]`
* `default[:postgresql][:wal_sender_delay]`
* `default[:postgresql][:wal_keep_segments]`
* `default[:postgresql][:vacuum_defer_cleanup_age]`
* `default[:postgresql][:replication_timeout]`
* `default[:postgresql][:synchronous_standby_names]` - If you want synchronous 
  replication, this must be a string containing a comma-separated list of node 
  names of the standby servers.
* `default[:postgresql][:standby_ips]` - A list of IP addresses for standbys. 
  These MUST be specified in a role.


### Standby Servers

* `default[:postgresql][:master_ip]` - This MUST Be specified in the role. It 
  lets the standby know how to connect to the master.
* `default[:postgresql][:hot_standby]` - set to `on` to enable hot standby.
* `default[:postgresql][:max_standby_archive_delay]`
* `default[:postgresql][:max_standby_streaming_delay]`
* `default[:postgresql][:wal_receiver_status_interval]`
* `default[:postgresql][:hot_standby_feedback]`

Recipes
=======

default
-------

This recipe just includes the `postgresql::client` recipe, which installs the
postgresql client package and required dependencies.

apt_postgresql_ppa
------------------
Adds sources for a PosgresSQL 9.1 package for _Ubuntu 10.04_. **NOTE** that this
recipe should only be used in Ubuntu 10.04. Newer versions of Ubuntu include
PostgreSQL 9.1 in their package repository.

To use this, you'll need to specify the PostgreSQL `version` and `dir` 
attributes. For example, add the folloing to your role:

    override_attributes(
      :postgresql => {
        :version => "9.1",
        :dir => "/etc/postgresql/9.1/main"  
      }
    ) 

client
------

Installs postgresql client packages and development headers during the
compile phase. 

ruby
----

**NOTE** This recipe may not currently work when installing Chef with
  the
  ["Omnibus" full stack installer](http://opscode.com/chef/install) on
  some platforms due to an incompatibility with OpenSSL. See
  [COOK-1406](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1406)

Install the `pg` gem under Chef's Ruby environment so it can be used
in other recipes.

server
------

Includes the `server_debian` or `server_redhat` recipe to get the appropriate
server packages installed and service managed. Also manages the configuration
for the server:

* generates a strong default password (via `openssl`) for `postgres`
* sets the password for postgres
* manages the `pg_hba.conf` file.

server\_debian
--------------

Installs the postgresql server packages, manages the postgresql service and
the postgresql.conf file.

server\_redhat
--------------

Manages the postgres user and group (with UID/GID 26, per RHEL package
conventions), installs the postgresql server packages, initializes the
database and manages the postgresql service, and manages the
postgresql.conf file.

setup
-----
Creates Roles (user account) and Databases from a data bag. See the *Usage*
section for more info.


Resources/Providers
===================

See the [database](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/database)
for resources and providers that can be used for managing PostgreSQL
users and databases.

Usage
=====

On systems that need to connect to a PostgreSQL database, add to a run list
`recipe[postgresql]` or `recipe[postgresql::client]`.

On systems that should be PostgreSQL servers, use `recipe[postgresql::server]`
in a run list. This recipe does set a password and expect to use it. It
performs a node.save when Chef is not running in `solo` mode. If you're using
`chef-solo`, you'll need to set the attribute 
`node['postgresql']['password']['postgres']` in your node's `json_attribs` file
or in a role.

Streaming Replication/Hot Standby
---------------------------------
To set this up, you'd need to:

1. Bootstrap the Nodes (you've got know know their IP addresses!)
2. Assign the `server` recipe to the master and slave nodes to install a
   standard postgresql server.
3. Log into the Standby machine and shut down PostgreSQL.
4. Create the Master/Standby Roles (see below) and apply to each node.
        * Make sure both nodes have access to each others' PostgreSQL service
          by adding the appropriate values for the `node['postgresql']['hba']`
          attribute.
5. Run `chef-client` on the Master. Wait for it to finish.
6. Run `chef-client` on the Standby. It will fail. That's ok. Log into the
   standby and make sure PostgreSQL is not running.
7. Log into the master and manually remove 
   `/var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/.initial_transfer_complete`, then re-run
   `chef-client` (it will again copy the database data directory 
   over to the standby via rsync, so you'll be prompted for a password unless 
   you've got public keys in place... make sure this step works!)
8. Restart postgresql on the master, then on the standby and run `chef-client`
   on both nodes. Check to make sure PostgreSQL's `sender` and `receiver`
   processes are running:
    * Run `ps -ef | grep sender` on the Master
    * Run `ps -ef | grep receiver` on the Standby
9. Subsequent runs of `chef-client` should work without any errors.

### Master Role
To configure a Master server, you would need to create a role that sets the 
appropriate properties. For example, given that you have a node namded `db2` 
with an ip address of `10.0.0.11`, you might create a role similar to the one 
below:

    name "pg_server_master"
    description "A PostgreSQL Master"
    run_list "recipe[postgresql::server]"

    override_attributes(
      :postgresql => {
        :version => "9.1",
        :dir => "/etc/postgresql/9.1/main",
        :master => true,
        :listen_addresses => "*",
        :wal_level => "hot_standby",
        :max_wal_senders => 5,
        :standby_ips => [ "10.0.0.11", ],
        :synchronous_standby_names => ["db2", ], # Omit this if you don't want
                                                 # synchronous replication
        :hba => [
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '127.0.0.1/32' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '::1/128' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '10.0.0.10' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '10.0.0.11' },
        ]
      }
    )

### Standby Role
To configure a Standby, you could create a similar role. Assuming the master 
was available at an ip address of `10.0.0.10`:

    name "pg_server_standby"
    description "A PostgreSQL Standby"
    run_list "recipe[postgresql::server]"

    override_attributes(
      :postgresql => {
        :version => "9.1",
        :dir => "/etc/postgresql/9.1/main",
        :standby => true,
        :hot_standby => "on",
        :master_ip => "10.0.0.10",
        :hba => [
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '127.0.0.1/32' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '::1/128' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '10.0.0.10' },
            { :method => 'md5', :address => '10.0.0.11' },
        ]
      }
    )

### User/Database Setup

To configure users and databases, create a data bag with the name used in the
`default[:postgresql][:databag]` attribute. Items in this databag will be used
to create both PostgreSQL users and databases. The format of each databag item
should be similar to the following:

    {
       "id": "sample_db_setup",
       "users": [
           {
               "username":"some_user",
               "password":"some_password",
               "superuser": "true",
           }
       ],
       "databases": [
           {
               "name":"some_db",
               "owner":"some_user", 
               "template":"template0",
               "encoding": "UTF8",
               "locale": "en_US.utf8"
           }
       ] 
    }


Then, override the `node['postgresql']['setup_items']` attribute in a role:

    override_attributes(
      :postgresql => {
        :databag     => "postgresql", # databag from which items are fetched
        :setup_items => ["sample_db_setup", ]  # name of item from which
                                               # user/database info is read.
      }
    )
